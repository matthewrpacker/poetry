<<<<<<< HEAD
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
=======
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
